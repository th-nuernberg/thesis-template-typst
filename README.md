# Typst Template for Theses and Reports at TH Nürnberg

Basic template for reports, bachelor's theses and master's theses at the [Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/).
This version of the template is intended for digital `PDF/A-2b` compliant submissions.
It is based on the [LaTeX Thesis Template](https://github.com/th-nuernberg/thesis-template) and tries to mirror it as closely as possible.

Feel free to use a local install of [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst#installation) or the [online editor](https://typst.app).

> [!WARNING]
> The `main` branch is build to be compatible with the new digital Thesis Platform of Computer Science Faculty.
> This Version does not create out of the box a book print format.
> If you need to use the "old" book print format, please open an issue so we can prioritize working on it.
> In the meantime, you can use the [`book-print`](https://github.com/th-nuernberg/thesis-template/tree/book-print) branch of the LaTeX version.

If you are new to Typst, get familiar with its syntax first by reading the [docs](https://typst.app/docs/) and the official [tutorial](https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/).

## Template options

The template function, enabled with `#show: thesis.with(...)` in [`document.typ`](document.typ), provides these options:

`*` Required parameter

### Abstract

To define your abstract, you use the `abstract` parameter.
If you write your thesis in German, you can simply provide `content`.

```typst
#show: thesis.with(
	// ...
  abstract: [
    This is my abstract ...
  ],
	// ...
)
```

Alternatively, you can provide a dictionary with `en` and `de` keys, each containing `content`.
The template renders whatever variant corresponds to the main text's language (set using `lang`) first and the alternative version second.
This is _required_ when writing your thesis in English.

```typst
#show: thesis.with(
	// ...
  abstract: (
    en: [
      This is my abstract ...
    ],
    de: [
      Das ist die Kurzdarstellung ...
    ],
  ),
	// ...
)
```

### Glossary

The glossary is powered by the [`glossarium`](https://typst.app/universe/package/glossarium) package.
Refer to its documentation for how to use it.
To define glossary entries, use the `glossary` parameter with a dictionary of the two required keys `acronyms` and `glossary`.

```typst
#show: thesis.with(
	// ...
  glossary: (
    acronyms: (
      // ...
    ),
    glossary: (
      // ...
    ),
  ),
	// ...
)
```

Since defining entries this way is tedious, feel free to use a separate [data file](https://typst.app/docs/reference/data-loading/).
The template logic allows you to use Typst syntax in markup mode inside the data file.
See the [`glossary.yaml`](glossary.yaml) for an example.

### Appendix

If you want to provide additional content aside from your main thesis, you can put it in the appendix.
To start writing, add the show rule `#show: appendix` _after_ your main content and _before_ your appendix content.
This will make sure everything is numbered and placed correctly.

```typst
// ...

= First Chapter

This is my thesis content ...

// ...

#show: appendix

= First Appendix

This is my appendix content ...

// ...
```

### Manual Mode

In case you (or your professor) don't like the structure of this template, you can set the `manual` option to true and lay out the document yourself.
All document parts are available through the `thesis-` functions.
Check out [`styles/ohm.typ`](styles/ohm.typ) to see how they can be used.

| Function                    | Description                                                                                                        |

## Compile your document

To build your thesis, you can use the online editor or a local Typst compiler.
Since it's required (and good practice) to submit the PDF in `PDF/A-2b` format, make sure to use the `--pdf-standard a-2b` flag.
To compile your document continuously (whenever something changes), you can use:

```
typst watch --pdf-standard a-2b document.typ
```

## Getting started: writing a thesis expose

A good start for a thesis is to write an expose for the thesis topic.
This repository also provides an expose template written in Typst; more about the expose can be found in the [expose README](expose/README.md) file.

## A few tips for writing your thesis

- Create a branch for your thesis; this allows you to easily sync with upstream (this repository).
- Disable automatic hard line wrap (with newlines); use soft wrap instead. [(What's that about?)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/319925/difference-between-hard-wrap-and-soft-wrap)
- Write one sentence per line -- this makes for nice diffs in git.
- For capitalization of headings, follow the [IEEE Style Manual](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/your-role-in-article-production/ieee-editorial-style-manual/).
- Use UTF-8 encoding for your files to make special characters work.
- Keep your literature up to date -- add references to your bib file as you read them.
